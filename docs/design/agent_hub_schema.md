# Agent Hub Schema Design

## Overview

This document outlines the design decisions for the AI Agent Hub schema.

## Schema Components

### Provider

Represents an organization or company that creates AI agents.

Key attributes:
- Name, description, and URL
- Support contact information
- GitHub repository and documentation links

### AgentMetadata

Detailed information about an AI agent, including its capabilities, requirements, and examples.

Key attributes:
- Basic information (name, description, version)
- Provider references
- Features and capabilities
- Technical requirements
- Supported LLMs and memory stores
- Example code snippets
- Documentation links

## Agent Features

### Memory Types
- Short-term
- Long-term
- Episodic
- Semantic

### Planning Capabilities
- None
- Basic
- Advanced
- Recursive
- Hierarchical

### Tool Use Capabilities
- None
- Predefined
- Dynamic
- Tool Creation

## Design Decisions

1. **Provider-Agent Hierarchy**
   - Agents are associated with providers (companies/frameworks) 
   - This allows filtering and organization by ecosystem

2. **Feature Classification**
   - Categorizing agent capabilities along standardized dimensions
   - Makes comparison between agents easier

3. **Domain Categorization**
   - Agents can be categorized by their primary domain (customer service, coding, etc.)
   - Facilitates discovery for specific use cases

4. **Example Code Integration**
   - Code snippets help users understand implementation
   - Import requirements clarify dependencies

5. **Resource Requirements**
   - Clear documentation of hardware/infrastructure needs
   - Helps users assess operational costs

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with standardized benchmarks for agent performance
- User review and rating system
- Versioning to track agent evolution over time
- Integration with deployment tools
